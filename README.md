#####Plugins not working as expected or app loading blank?
First [check if the plugin you're using is supported by View](http://docs.ionic.io/v1.0/docs/view-usage)

If it is and it still isn't working, try: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-view-issues/issues/52#issuecomment-99250866

If it's not and you would like to see it supported, request to have it added:
https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-view-issues/issues/15
