Here you can open issues for [Ionic View](http://docs.ionic.io/tools/view/).

#####Plugins not working as expected or app loading blank?
First [check if the plugin you're using is supported by View](http://docs.ionic.io/tools/view/#supported-plugins)

If it's not and you would like to see it supported, request to have it added:
