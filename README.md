Here you can open issues for [Ionic View](http://docs.ionic.io/tools/view/).

## Common Issues

#### App loading blank or white screen on load?
First [check if the plugin you're using is supported by View](http://docs.ionic.io/tools/view/#supported-plugins)

If it's not and you would like to see it supported, [request to have it added](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-view-issues/issues/15).
